<!-- 
Exclude models from your run -->
<!-- 
dbt provides an --exclude flag with the same semantics as --select. Models specified with the --exclude flag will be removed from the set of models selected with --select. -->
dbt run --select "my_package".*+ --exclude "my_package.a_big_model+"    # select all models in my_package and their children except a_big_model and its children
<!-- 
Exclude a specific resource by its name or lineage: -->

dbt test --exclude "not_null_orders"

## seed
dbt seed --exclude "parent_mappings"

## snapshots

dbt snapshot --exclude "parent_not_mappings"
